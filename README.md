# CT-Refactoring-HW

In this Homework we were tasked with Refactoring existing code so that the HTML elements were semantic and easier to read. By getting rid of a lot of the "div" functions and replacing them with things like "section", "aside", and "figure" it becomes much simpler and "cleaner" looking.

In the css file I was able to restructure the attributes according to how they were viewed on the page as well as tidying up some code that was unneccesary.

By adding a title to the code the viewer is now able to see a small description of the page in their tabs.

I also added alt attributes to the images so that incase they were not able to load for some reason the viewer would then have a short description of the images.

By making these changes the code is a lot easier to navigate while making no visible changes to the non semantic version.
